# SuperStore
This application is about Super-Market scenario. At Billing counter, bill is generated having item information, total amount , customer id and transaction id; customer rewarded with some points; in parallel one need to update the stock and customer points.

I have made an application on Supermarket using C++ language. In this application, the customer can buy items and the automated bill will be generated. In this application, parallel inventory will be updated and customer data will be generated.

There are specifications of some functionalities listed below:

```sh
1. Inventory Dataset maintains items and stock information.
2. Manager can have all the access to this inventory Dataset.
3. Billing object has all the functionality that we generally encounter at
billing counter like bill generation, add new customer to customer Dataset
and update points and update inventory.
```

## Sample Output
